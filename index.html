      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a software developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Khartoum, Sudan</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to code</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Data Scientist</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Greensboro, North Carolina </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p> I know that the possibilities are limitless now that I have this new superpower, called coding. I also understand that my level of effort is in direct correlation of my career advancement. With low barriers to entry, I have the power to solve the same problems that Fortune 500 companies are trying to solve, but at home. That is what excites me the most as a 1st generation immigrant and a 1st-generation college student who has faced many obstacles growing up.</p>
